<h1>Robby Thomen PhD</h1>
<h2>Assistant Professor</h2>
<h2>Radiology, BioEngineering</h2>
<h2>&#9820 Radiology M210P</h2>
<h2>&#9993; One Hospital Drive, DC069.10, Columbia MO, 65202</h2>
<h2>&#9742; (573) 882-1026</h2>
<h2>&#9000; <a href="mailto:thomenr@health.missouri.edu">thomenr@health.missouri.edu</a></h2>
<p>Dr Thomen received his doctorate in physics from Washington University in St Louis, and completed his postdoc in pulmonary imaging at Cincinnati Children's Hospital - both under the direction of Dr Jason Woods. His research interests include novel applications of medical imaging technology to improving the clinical standard of care. In particular, his work has focused on hyperpolarized gas MRI of lungs - a method of obtaining a complete map of lung function (ventilation, gas-exchange, perfusion) in a single breathold via MRI. Students interested in getting involved should reach out via email.</p>

<h1>Talissa Altes, MD</h1>
<h2>Professor</h2>
<h2>Chair, Radiology</h2>
<p>Dr Altes is the Chair of the Department of Radiology at MU, a pediatric radiologist, and lung imaging researcher. Prior to joining MU while she was at the University of Virginia (UVA) and became involved in lung imaging research using hyperpolarized gas as a non-toxic, non-radioactive inhaled contrast agent for MRI. Together with John Mugler, PhD and Eduard de Lange, MD, Dr Altes built a very strong hyperpolarized gas MRI research program. She pioneered the application of this technique in a variety of lung diseases including asthma, cystic fibrosis (CF), and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (also known as chronic lung disease of prematurity). The lab performed hyperpolarized gas MRI in more human subjects than any other site, and UVA is considered one of the preeminent sites for hyperpolarized gas MRI. Her background in engineering has enabled her to work closely with the MRI physicists and gives her a depth of understanding of their work.</p>
