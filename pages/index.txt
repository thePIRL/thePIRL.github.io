<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>Welcome to the homepage for the Mizzou Pulmonary Imaging Research Lab! Here you can learn about our research and become familiar with our goals, methods, and discoveries. The research interests of the group involve investigation of pulmonary structure-function relationships using various medical imaging modalities such as CT, proton MRI, and hyperpolarized noble gas MRI of the lung. These studies are imperative to understanding how lung architecture relates to pulmonary ventilation and gas-exchange, and are also necessary for furthering development of treatments for various pulmonary abnormalities such as asthma, COPD, cystic fibrosis, bronchiolitic obliterans, and others.</p>
